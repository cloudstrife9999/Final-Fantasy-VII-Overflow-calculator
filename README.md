# Final-Fantasy-VII-Overflow-calculator

TODO:

implement a graphical visualization of the results.
implement the fact that limits override the ultimate weapons POWM with their own POWM = LMUL * (TPOW/16).
implement all the non-ultimate weapons.
refactor the code (this was a rush job).
fix a possible error in the RV overflows count (possible switch between AOV and OV when BD is negative).
