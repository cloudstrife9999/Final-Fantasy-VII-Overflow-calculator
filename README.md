# Final-Fantasy-VII-Overflow-calculator

TODO:

Finish implementing the fact that limits override the ultimate weapons POWM with their own POWM = LMUL * (TPOW/16).

Implement all the non-ultimate weapons.

Refactor the code (this was a rush job).

Fix a possible error in the RV overflows count (possible switch between AOV and OV when BD is negative).
