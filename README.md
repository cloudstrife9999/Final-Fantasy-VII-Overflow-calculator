# Final-Fantasy-VII-Overflow-calculator

TODO (non-exhaustive list in no particular order):

Implement all the non-ultimate weapons.

Refactor the code (this was a rush job).

Fix a possible error in the RV overflows count (possible switch between AOV and OV when BD is negative).

Implement MP damage (i.e., blood fang/hammer blow) and MP overflow.

Implement HP Absorb / MP Absorb integration.

Find a smart way to collect the exact amount of APs on the Missing Score without a JTextField and without slowing down the UI.
